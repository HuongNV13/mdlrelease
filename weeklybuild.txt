1/ for all the branches >= 20_STABLE && master, pull changes from:
   git://github.com/amosbot/moodle.git (install_xxxxx branches match)
   and push them to integration. Some day we'll automate this.

A) STEPS FOR MAJOR RELEASE GO HERE!!! (follow them if necessary)

3/ update version.php of all changed branches, creating tags - on minor release,
   pointing to the version.php commit with git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m MOODLE_XYZ <COMMITID> -
   and push to integration (pushing tags too)
